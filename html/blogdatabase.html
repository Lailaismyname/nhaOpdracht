        <h2>How to Win a Game of Chess Without Really Trying</h2>
        <p>Disclaimer: There is no easy way to win a game of chess. But that’s only if by “winning” you mean hunting down your opponent’s king until he is gasping for air in a solitary corner, his vision fading into the black and white static of the board as your opponent (John, Meera, or Jeremy) commits seppuku by resignation. Only gradually will you return to the hard seats and smudged tabletops of your school’s B-grade lunch counter. You'll blink in a daze at the face of your opponent who, you must remember, is your friend in real life.</p>
        <p>If it’s John, you know he'll vent his frustration through his unusually long and eloquent middle finger. If it’s Meera, she’ll run back over every move and wonder where she went wrong. If it’s Jeremy, he’ll congratulate you with sad sad eyes that are worse than failure. You wouldn’t inflict that suffering on them even if you could; you’re the kind of person who catches wasps under a glass and escorts them outside, for crying out loud. At least, that’s how you rationalize your consistent losses. No, in order to win a game of chess, you will have to define your own purposes on your own terms. </p>
        <p>Objective. You may not fully understand your objective yourself at first, but you have a sneaking suspicion that there’s a reason you’re always willing to play losing games. The trick is not to let any of your opponents realize your motives– what if someone tries to obstruct them? Perhaps the best way to explain the goal right now is “figure out your objective before your opponent does.” </p>
        <p>Players. You will need the four members of your unofficial club known as RCIA, or the Racially Confused Individuals Association. To join, you must be a “halfsie”– half-white, half-non-white. This is of course a reference to the half-white, half-black of the chessboard, but also a testament to the nature of halfness itself: 50/50, incompletion, the friendship charm your bestie gave you when you moved from California and promptly forgot about. Sometimes you feel that you are simply that, two halves of a whole; two halves that, I might add, don’t always get along. </p>
        <p>You: Half-Mexican who joined a chess club in second grade and haven’t improved since then. Power: You can quote the entire script of Napoleon Dynamite by heart, in case that comes in handy (somehow it never does). </p>
        <p>John: Half-Korean chess wiz who loses once in a blue moon, sulking for several weeks each time. Power: He’s the one who came up with “RCIA”– in spite of everything, you have to admit that he's the funniest of everyone. </p>
        <p>Meera: Half-Indian, specifically Keralite. She is new to chess, but she is an English major, and her sensitivity to the poetics of chess gives her a unique advantage. Power: Meera always comes the closest to guessing your Secret Objective™️. You need to keep careful watch on her. </p>
        <p>Jeremy: Jeremy is technically half-white, it’s just that his other half is also white. But he is a quarter Portuguese, which is practically Spanish, which is practically Mexican, and if you’re allowed to join then so is he. Power: Jeremy actually studies chess moves in his spare time. Maybe even listens to chess podcasts. The mind boggles.</p>
        <p>BONUS PLAYER: Josh is the half-Japanese barista who sits and watches you play on occasion. You probably won’t see him during this game, but he may make your coffees. Power: Doesn’t know how to play chess, and yet still knows more than you do. </p>
        <p>The Game Plan. The proper way to set up chess between friends is two v. two, then have winners play each other. You'll play John first; you know that he knows that you know that you won’t make it to the next round, but he will graciously refrain from saying so. </p>
        <p>First, he will offer to let you play white so you can have the first move. You must say, “Why do whites always get to go first?” It used to be a joke, but now it’s a formal ritual. If you skip this step, you might as well give yourself up for lost before you begin. </p>
        <p>Next, agonize over which of the pieces you’re supposed to start with. You should really know by now which openings are best, but you can never remember whether it’s the center-right pawn or the center-left pawn, and whether it should move one or two spaces. Two spaces is bolder: it shows confidence, aggression, a “Morticia Addams eyebrow raise” that suggests (falsely) that you know something John doesn’t. It’s the Indiana Jones of opening moves. Make a feint for the left pawn, then the right, then say, “Actually, I think I should move my knight first.” Keep him in constant uncertainty.</p>
        <p>You'll realize as soon as your fingertips leave your piece that you've made the wrong choice. Stay calm. The best chess player in the world doesn’t fear the second best, but the worst: you are entirely unpredictable. It will make you feel safe to remember that John cannot read your mind. And if he can’t guess your next move, he can’t guess your objective. For this reason it is absolutely imperative that you continue to make this sort of play. </p>
        <p>It helps if you imagine each of your pieces as a complex, tragic figure. The king is quite elderly, while everyone knows that his dominant and domineering wife wears the pants around here. The two bishops are rivals involved in court intrigue to varying extents. The one that slides along the white squares is the queen’s confessor and a potential turncoat, which explains his mysterious, seemingly irrational decisions. Your black-squares bishop is loyal, but self-interestedly so. His moves are cool, politic, ruthless. This pawn here is overly hesitant, perhaps a bit stuffy; his brother, on the other hand, is reckless and self-sacrificing. Shake your head at his folly, though you admire his courage, and sigh when he falls into the clutches of one of John’s greedy knights (his knights have questionable claims to the title, and are maybe only vigilantes). </p>
        <p>N.B.: It’s very important that this whole time you accuse John of making up moves in order to cheat, no matter how many times he’s explained the rules to you. </p>
        <p>John will frown and try to discover your strategy, then quickly realize that you just don’t understand chess (you do, but you have your own intentions). He'll start to relax, absently pulling on the thin beard he's grown in the last week (John shaves every time he showers, but like most Koreans he doesn't produce body odor. True story). In the long stretches between his moves and yours, he’ll mention in the way he always does that he doubts his own existence. You are a math major and can prove to him, mathematically, that he does in fact exist. John will then counter by doubting the existence of math; he’s a philosophy major. You will be tempted to insinuate that philosophy does not exist, thus triggering an existential crisis of a magnitude visible from Mars. Do not, I repeat, do not give in to this particular impulse. Instead, ask him if that means he concedes. Of course he doesn’t concede. Throw him off the scent of your real objective, the one that is still hidden from yourself.</p>
        <p>Drink loads of bad coffee in order to get rid of your migraines. When that doesn’t work, continue to insist that they are caused by caffeine withdrawal. Josh will brew you drink after drink (Josh made it into the game after all– what a pleasant surprise) and give John something else to talk about. John will say your coffee is bad. It’s too cold; it’s too bitter; Josh poured too many grounds into the machine. He is complaining about your coffee, that you’re drinking and he hasn’t even tasted. Maybe he’s trying to distract you from the game. Just smile and play along. You are on the cusp of discovering the purpose of chess, or even the meaning of life, which when you come down to it are really the same thing.</p>
        <p>Meera must have beaten Jeremy because you will hear her belly-laughing a couple tables over. She has the most wonderful laugh you’ve ever heard: surprised and joyful and careless and serious all at once. She laughs so hard you can't believe her glasses stay on her face. She and Jeremy like to watch the tail ends of your games. Jeremy will remark that this is the most interesting board he's ever seen, and you agree. One of your pawns, the stuffy one, will have snapped and decided to avenge his brother, securing a promotion to Second Queen. The rest of your pawns will form a diagonal across the further right corner and imprison John’s rooks. But despite their noble efforts, John is only mopping up your mess with a few swift strokes of the black queen and his remaining black bishop. The black rooks will pass through your white pawns like smoke.</p>
        <p>And it won’t bother you.</p>
        <p>Because you were never afraid of losing the game, just afraid that there was never a game to play. Afraid that you have less in common with yourself than you thought, afraid that 50/50 really means 0/0, because you are not white and you are not Mexican and no matter what you told John or how well you argue otherwise, you are afraid you don’t exist. </p>
        <p>Chess is conflict. It’s nice to know, for a little while, that you are a person who is capable of being conflicted. You are a person who exists. And there is another person, one outside of you, who is conflicted in the same way and who recognizes you as a whole.</p>
        <p>“Checkmate.” </p>
        <p>Two sides of the same coin. 50/50. Completion. The halves of a friendship charm clicking into place. </p>
        <p>You all have the same objective, one that no one knew was a secret except for you. </p>
        <p><em>Checkmate.</em></p>

        <h2>Don't take the teleporter</h2>
        <p>It’s almost time to leave the office for the day when your coworker approaches. The one you don’t like because they seem to know everything and have a holier than thou attitude about it. They are constantly on the prowl at the end of the day looking for some poor colleague to distract for the last 15 minutes of the workday to ensure they can’t finish whatever they were working on before quitting time. Today that person is you. </p>
        <p>They lean into your cubicle with a cold cup of coffee in one hand and say conspiratorially, “Hey, don’t take the teleporter home today. I hear it’s on the fritz.” </p>
        <p>“So what,” you respond, “I’m going to end up in my living room instead of the kitchen?” </p>
        <p>This is a possibility, of course. That is the most common teleporter accident, the ‘mis-constitution.’ There are worse accidents like a partial reconstitution, wave reformation, and the dreaded inverse reconstitution which is always fatal. These are all exceedingly rare. </p>
        <p>Your coworker responds, “This is how it starts. All I’m saying is first you end up in the living room instead of the kitchen and next thing you know, you’re inside out. Take the long way home is all I’m saying.”</p>
        <p>The long way home. It’s enough to make you risk the slight chance of inverse reconstitution. Walking the long, white, empty hallways out of the office, trekking down the hill to the bus terminal, waiting for a bus in the cold rain. That’s just the beginning! 30 minutes later you’ll be walking from the bus into a dirty, dark metro station where you’ll wait with an assorted group of sketchy underdwellers before searching for a clean seat, then standing on the train for another 30 minutes and finally walking the last quarter mile home in the rain. </p>
        <p>“Something could happen to me on the way home,” you respond. This is good, now you’re turning the tables on your smug coworker.</p>
        <p>Things do happen to people while walking after all. You could get hit by a falling air conditioner or piano. You could get hit by a car and need a hip-replacement. What are the chances of that happening compared to a teleporter accident? You heard once that 94 percent of airplane accidents aren’t fatal. How is this possible? A giant metal tube crammed with hundreds of people moving hundreds of miles per hour crashes and no one dies? The teleporter must be at least that safe. It simply deconstructs your body molecule by molecule, transports it in sequence to a new location and reconstructs everything in order. There is no way that is more difficult than getting a multi-ton airplane to 30,000 feet. In any case, the litany of risks and inconveniences make taking the long way home a clear second to teleportation. </p>
        <p>It’s clear that your coworker isn’t yielding. It’s too late in the day and the motivation to go back to their desk at this point is low. “Sure, something could happen if you take the long way home, but think of everything you miss when you take the teleporter. You can’t meet anyone in the metro, you don’t get any exercise. Plus, you could stop and get a beer on the way home if you walk.” </p>
        <p>“I don’t really drink beer,” you respond. </p>
        <p>Beer! Forget about it! The horrible dives between the office and your house are places to black out, get into a fight, or both. These aren’t relaxing after work watering holes. Even if they were, the prospect is hardly an incentive for someone who would rather be home sooner than later. And who would consider meeting underdwellers on the metro a benefit of taking the long way home? The troglodytic denizens who make up the workforce of the city’s other offices are not conversation material unless you’re having a conversation about them with someone else. “That lady practically has a second head!” “Where does he work dressed like that?” Undoubtedly they feel the same way about you and the chances of striking up a conversation are low. Any interaction is likely the negative result of accidentally bumping into someone or stepping on their shoe. Running a few minutes here or there in the rain is hardly motivation for skipping the teleporter either. Could it even be considered exercise? You’d be lucky not to slip in a puddle and end up missing a week of work. At least you wouldn’t have to worry about your commute that week.</p>
        <p>You have to get out of this conversation. The day is almost over and in a few minutes you can grab your briefcase, step into the teleporter and within seconds you’ll be standing in your apartment. You decide to go on the offensive. “If I take the long way home, it will take me over an hour to get to my apartment. I could get hit by a falling piano or a car. I will get rained on. I will have to avoid underdwellers in the metro and I’m not choking down a beer at a graffiti covered bar on a Monday night!” You try not to sound too aggressive but by the end your voice has raised to a heated pitch. </p>
        <p>“Okay, okay.” Your coworker backs off with a shrug. “I’m just saying, Johnston from sales left early and tried to go to the grocery store and I heard the teleporter left him in the parking lot of a gas station four blocks away. That’s how it starts, you know.” Your coworker cocks their head and raises the coffee cup as if to say, ‘think about it.’ </p>
        <p>It’s time to leave the office. You stand up. Your coworker checks their watch, “time to go,” they say. They start down a long row of cubicles that leads towards the teleporter at the end of the office. You look down that long row of cubicles. Your coworker slows their walk, waiting for you to catch up. Do they want to keep talking? That is a long, long row of cubicles, you think. With a sigh, you turn the other way toward the office door. You’ll be taking the long way home today. </p>

        <h2>Why you didn't get a holiday card from me.</h2>
        <p>The colors could only be painted by the hand of god it seemed as I fixed my gaze on the view before me. Towering pines that seemed to tickle the blue sky, line the banks of a small crystal clear river as it charges out confidently into the valley ahead. The only audience of its journey over the millennium are the the snow capped mountains which stand proud over the valley. I imagined myself a fearless explorer seeing this spot for the first time when suddenly, I became aware of my wife's voice echoing thru the valley..."Ed you idiot lets go...stop staring at that picture and come on".... and just like that I turned away from the National Park poster by the security office and proceed to walked out of Walmart behind my wife in shame clutching your 3ft Giant Holiday Card which you will not be getting from me this year.</p>
        <p>Knowing how tough a year it has been, I wanted to be sure I said thank you for being my customer this holiday season. So my wife and I went to Walmart and while she was shopping, I went straight to the greeting card aisle to find you a card. However, being as neurotic as I am, I had to find the “Perfect” card for you and with all the other holiday shoppers doing the same…. inventory was slim and let’s just say things got a little competitive. Now, I don’t know how much time actually passed but all of a sudden I heard my wife screaming my name from down the lisle and that’s when I became aware that I was boxing out a gray haired old lady with my right hip and forearm while holding a card with my left hand yelling “Go away you fossil.. I found it first! It’s my card, mine, mine, mine” as she banged on my ankles with her walking cane. Now, my wife being the adult in the marriage grabbed me by my ear took the card away and apologetically gave it back to the old lady…(apparently her name is Ruth) then turned to me with disgust and said “you Idiot” just give them that, pointing to Giant Holiday Card right at the end of the aisle. What would I do without her?</p>
        <p>So after some ridicule, signatures and photos in the security office we got to leave Walmart. Once home I went to the fridge, made me a ham sandwich on rye with mustard, poured me a glass of milk, then sat down at my desk with the Giant Holiday Card and started to write.</p>
        <p>Well wouldn’t you know, I haven’t hand written an actual letter since 7th grade and I kept writing in this mixture of cursive and printing which resembled something similar to Hieroglyphics and I ruined the Giant Holiday Card. Frustrated and angry, I bribed my wife with new shoes to go back and get me another card (since I am not allowed in Walmart for 6 months) and made the decision to just stick with printing.</p>
        <p>Sure enough, just as I started to write, I developed a bad case of writer's block and ended up sitting at my desk for 40 minutes mumbling to myself like the village idiot and wondering if the ocean didn’t have sponges would it be deeper. Glad to say, I pulled through and words of gratitude began to flow off my pen with such fondness it would have brought tears to a unicorn. Once finished, I gave it a proof read admiring my talents and to my horror….. I spelled sincerely wrong.</p>
        <p>Now, I have to be honest I did consider just leaving it and hoping it would be missed but considering you would be displaying the Giant Holiday Card at your desk with pride for everyone to see, there was a good chance people would notice. So…I carefully tried to convert the A to an E but that ended up turning it into a scribbled ink mess in the middle of sincerely and that was not going to fly. Out of cards and out of options I was forced to use the dreaded white out. As I reached across my desk to grab it; wouldn’t you know it…mustard from my ham sandwich got on my sleeve and ended up right on your card.</p>
        <p>Frustrated, yet determined to not let this card go to waste, I had to come up with a solution. Then like an old shoe upside the head it hit me….I would draw pictures. The yellow mustard could be the sun, I would add some grass and clouds, maybe a stick figure of me and my stick figure wife holding hands… It was the perfect solution. So I jumped from my chair and went to my arts and crafts box but just my luck, the blue marker was dry and the green appeared to have been chewed on by a small mammal of some sort. I was so upset at this point I slammed my fists on the desk causing me to spill my glass of milk right on the card. In my attempt react to the milk I ended up knocking the very ham sandwich that caused this right on the floor. Well, being a firm believer in the 5 second rule and attempting to beat our Bulldog Cheeseburger to it.. I immediately bent down to grab it and smacked my forehead right on the desk.</p>
        <p>This has been a very stressful experience for me. I am banned from Walmart, my wife has my credit card and new shoes, there are mustard stains on my shirt, spilled milk on my desk, I'm hungry and the dog ate my sandwich and now I don't have a card for you. Not to mention there is a Looney Toons lump on my forehead.</p>
        <p>So please maybe you will find it in your heart to accept this as your Holiday Card simply saying Thank You for being my customer. I hope this brings a smile to your face as you are very appreciated. And though I don’t have an actual card…..isn’t it really the thought that counts.</p>

        <h2>Love and Ghost Stories </h2>
        <p>I try to escape my past, but it somehow finds a way to follow me, no matter where I go. I left my old hometown to get away from the place we once lived. Where we had all our happy memories, and the sad ones too. How foolish I was to believe I could get away from him!</p>
        <p>No matter where I go, he’s always still inside my heart and my soul. How can I get away from a ghost who insists on living inside me? Even now that he’s dead, maybe even more than before, I think about him every day.</p>
        <p>Is it grief or merely my imagination that I tend to see him in the strangest places, that reminders keep popping up like that jack-in-the-box that used to scare me when I was three? I see his smile in a new Dad’s face, looking at his baby girl. I hear his laugh in the wind, see his face on a cloudy day, drifting by in the sky. Is this his way of saying goodbye? To remind my mortal self that death is not the end?</p>
        <p>At times I think I must be going crazy from the grieving process, others I feel his presence like the scent of incense drifting by as you pass a temple. Is his soul trying to say something to me? Is it all in my head? I am conflicted, you see before I lost him physically, we had been divorced for years. Ten years of marriage and all the memories that go with it aren’t so easily forgotten.</p>
        <p>Why now, when it’s too late to even say goodbye, do my thoughts and dreams keep coming around to him again? I wonder if I should chalk it up to guilt, or the supernatural. I believe there is a life after death, that we don’t just disappear when the soul leaves the body. But this up-close and personal proof is a bit much even for me.</p>
        <p>You know the old saying, “you can’t take it with you”? Well it seems like love is the exception to that rule. In fact, love is the only thing you can touch someone with, from the other side of that great divide between the living and the dead. The thought of his spirit still being near comforts me, even as it sort of creeps me out. Is he watching when I’m in bed with my new love? I can hear his ghost now, “Don’t need to see THAT…my eyes, my eyes!”</p>
        <p>You can laugh at that it was meant as a joke. The reality is unsettling, unnerving, and weird, but also soothing in a strange way. To dream that when you go, you can still show your love to the one you hurt the most. I’d like a chance like that. </p>
        <p>Dealing with hearing his thoughts in my head is another matter entirely. Its like I hear him now. Closer than when I used to push his wheelchair around the town I left, because it hurt too much to see our old home with new owners. Because every street I walked down had a memory. I thought if I left, the past would be left there, and I could finally move on. Somehow that didn’t work out the way I planned.</p>
        <p>The best laid plans of ghosts and ex-wives…I know that isn’t the way it goes, I’m trying to make a point here. Don’t think that you can leave a memory or a spirit behind like a lost piece of luggage. If you could, I’d be at the spiritual baggage claim, trying to exchange him for a less annoying haunting. I jest of course, but the point is the same. When love is that strong, even death is no barrier. You carry someone around with you in your memories, in your deepest self.</p>
        <p>He pops up at the strangest times, having a mental conversation with me. I find myself in the eerie position of him dictating a letter from himself to my new husband, warning him to treat me right. Do you think I’m crazy, or need to speak to a shrink or perhaps an exorcist? I would have thought the same once upon a time. At least I try to do it privately if I can. I can almost see myself and the strange looks directed at my back, if I walked around in public having a talk with nobody. Call her doctor and arrange some better medication, toot suite!</p>
        <p>I don’t need a rubber room, a straight jacket, or better sedatives. What I really want is a warning label somewhere in the vows. Something like, “Until death do us part…if I feel like it…I’ll decide later.” His sense of humor would have liked the idea of that. He was kind of weird when he was alive. Now that he’s a ghost, he can ramp up the spooky whenever he feels the urge.</p>
        <p>I’m not trying to scare you really, just some friendly advice, widow to widow. Casper has got nothing on this guy. At least he tried to be friendly. My ghost just wants to be annoying and sarcastic. Or if he feels up to it, reassuring and loving, even apologetic. I don’t know what to expect from one day to the next. When we were still together, he used to joke about haunting me. At the time, I thought he was just joking. Guess again!</p>
        <p>Having your ex floating around, making little digs at your lover, is a little disconcerting, to say the least. To give you a sample of what I mean, the letter I referred to earlier began; To Rock-Head. (it makes more sense when I tell you his real name is Rocky) He ended the missive with the parting shot, “I’m dead now, not in a wheelchair, a-hole.”</p>
        <p>I’m thinking to myself, “Give me a break, will you? He’s going to think this nonsense is coming from me!” I can hear the ghost laughing to himself, something like, “He had every word coming to him for a long time. So what? He can’t kill me all over again. What’s he gonna do? I’m already haunting him and you. Starting an argument would be fun. Hmm…wonder what else would royally piss him off?”</p>
        <p>Don’t think that’s an exaggeration, because this is coming from a guy who threatened to stick his crutch where the sun doesn’t shine on a regular basis, once. You think his personality is magically going to improve, just because he’s dead? </p>
        <p>As the saying goes, keep your friends close, and your enemies closer. How much closer can you get than floating right beside them, making little jokes at their expense? What an afterlife! You can piss off the most powerful, the biggest guy in the room (in this case, his replacement in my life) and there’s not a damn thing they can do about it! Come to think of it, what was that phone number again…I need to call GhostBusters! </p>

        <h2>The First Date (or, The Bouquet of a Dozen Mistakes)</h2>
        <p>In my defense, it had been six years since I had been on a date. Yes, you read that part right. Six. Long. Years. And yes, you read the next part right, too. Not “in a relationship”, but “on a date.” If you haven’t already guessed, my “in a relationship” time chasm was even wider.</p>
        <p>It’s not the sort of thing you want to put on your dating profile, you know? Tall and slender, early thirties. Likes working out. Dog person. Has been 2,193 days since any meaningful contact with the opposite sex.</p>
        <p>Lucas and I had messaged each other on an online dating app over the past several days, and tonight would be our first time meeting in person. I tried to stifle my nervousness by humming while I got ready.</p>
        <p>My first mistake was deciding to wear a white blouse. Sure, as I was getting ready at home, I heard the tiny voice of my conscience (who apparently doubles as my fashion advisor) desperately whispering to me, “Don’t do it.” But the white blouse was the only reasonably cute and clean shirt hanging in my closet. I took it off the hanger, stole a guilty glance at the massive pile of dirty laundry on the floor, and whispered back, “I’ll just be extra careful.”</p>
        <p>I was nearly finished doing my hair, which I rarely ever made a fuss about, when I checked my phone and realized I hadn’t left myself enough time - that was my second mistake. I looked in the mirror. The curls on the left side of my face were impressive - wavy, loose, natural-looking. Like a model on a beach in Hawaii. The hair on the right side of my face looked like a poodle had jumped into an industrial ribbon-curler.</p>
        <p>I ran my fingers through my hair, let out a tiny wail, slung my purse over my shoulder and ran out the door.</p>
        <p>I swerved into the parking lot of the Italian restaurant four minutes late, nudged my car into a tight spot between a vehicle, a fire hydrant, and the curb, and walked briskly inside.</p>
        <p>Lucas was already at a table waiting for me so, after being seated, I awkwardly apologized for my lateness. He waved it off and handed me a little bouquet of a dozen pink wild roses. They were beautiful and, unlike a massive bouquet of deep red roses on a first date, felt more charming than concerning. But I felt extra guilty for being late.</p>
        <p>I nervously dug in my purse for a lip balm, and then felt dread come over me as I realized my third mistake - that, in my haste to leave the house, I had left my wallet sitting on the table in the entry hallway. Lucas and I had already discussed the bill to alleviate any awkwardness at the meal, and we agreed to each pay for our portion. I pretended to look at the menu while my fingers were wildly searching the depth of my purse for any cash. I had…a ten, a five, a few dollar bills and some change. Whew, just enough for a cheap dinner and a tip. Disaster averted.</p>
        <p>Lucas and I chatted while we waited for our drinks. The restaurant was welcoming, with dim lighting and low music, and we had been seated in a private tucked-away corner. A small vase with fresh flowers adorned the center of the table, and two tall pillar candles added a pretty glow.</p>
        <p>The waitress returned with our drinks and took our orders. My fourth mistake was ordering the chicken parmesan with red sauce (more on this to come later), but it was the Saturday night special and was the cheapest thing on the menu.</p>
        <p>My fifth mistake of the evening was during an awkward pause in the conversation. Most conversations have pauses, and some conversations have awkward pauses. But conversations on first dates win the gold medal for extra-special awkward pauses.</p>
        <p>You know the kind. One of you is talking about something (the topic isn’t important) and inevitably trails off into an unintelligible mumble as you realize that the conversation is dwindling. And then the silence comes. Not a comfortable, familiar silence. But a silence that gnaws at you both and gets increasingly louder as the seconds tick by.</p>
        <p>To the last person who spoke, the silence says, What is wrong with you? Why did you say that you like eating brined pickles dipped in cheese powder? She’s going to think you’re so weird! Say you were just kidding. No, it’s too late to take it back now. Look, now she’s staring at you!</p>
        <p>To the person who was listening, it says just as loud, Think of a response! Think of a response! He told you about the pickles and cheese powder. Now you have to tell him about your secret hoard of stale two-year-old caramel chews from England, hidden in the back of the pantry, that you break out when you’re feeling insecure. Wait, no, don’t say that! Just say … something!</p>
        <p>Lucas had just finished telling me a story about his grandma winning some quilt show years ago, and I tried to think of a response but kept coming up blank. I didn’t know anything about quilts. And the more I tried to think of something to say, the louder the silence became. His smile faded and he shifted in his chair.</p>
        <p>Without thinking I panicked, laughed nervously, and blurted out, “Well, at least she didn’t give you the quilt!” As the words left my mouth, I remembered with horror that three minutes earlier Lucas said his grandma gifted it to him as a baby.</p>
        <p>Lucas looked confused, and I realized - thank God - that he hadn’t heard me. The waiter arrived with our entrees right then, so I completely changed the subject. I hoped he hadn’t noticed.</p>
        <p>Mistake number six was asking for extra napkins. I wasn’t generally a messy eater, but I wanted to give a good impression tonight and, if that meant I needed a few extra napkins with which to dab my mouth, then so be it. The waiter brought several extra linen napkins and set them near my plate. I thought I saw the waiter, and possibly the napkins, give me a disapproving glance.</p>
        <p>The seventh mistake was setting my fork on the bottom edge of my plate after digging into my parmesan chicken. Lucas said something that made me laugh, and I leaned forward. My arm caught the end of my fork and flipped it end over end. I could see thick red sauce coating the tines, and I reached out in slow motion to catch it, hoping against all hope. As my hands flailed for the fork, a memory from high school flashed by. I had worked at a gardening shop, and it was my job to catch goldfish to plop into waiting bags of water to sell. It was like trying to scoop up a bar of wet soap that was also alive, wriggling, and trying to escape. Easy, right?</p>
        <p>Despite my well-honed goldfish catching skills, the fork landed on my clean white shirt and spattered bright red sauce all over the front of it. It looked like some scene out of a slasher movie.</p>
        <p>My eighth mistake was about to be made. I ran to the bathroom in embarrassment to try to get the stains out, paused in front of the sink, and thought for a moment. Is it hot water for berries and cold water for tomato sauce? Or cold water for blood and hot water for tomato sauce? I guessed cold. I was wrong. I walked back to the table with a shirt that looked like, after the slasher scene, it had gone through a wash cycle with a loofa and an open bottle of ketchup.</p>
        <p>The ninth mistake of the night was when I sprinkled more pepper on my chicken parmesan (even with the tomato sauce it was bland). The pepper shaker wasn’t cooperating, so I unscrewed the cap and carefully sprinkled the pepper straight out of the opening. I didn’t hear anything Lucas said because I was concentrating so hard, and felt proud when I didn’t dump the whole shaker’s worth of pepper out all at once. I recapped the shaker and breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
        <p>Just as Lucas was asking me a question, my left eye started to itch so I reached up and rubbed ground pepper squarely into my eye.</p>
        <p>Mistakes ten, eleven, and twelve then followed in rapid succession.</p>
        <p>I wanted to dip my napkin in the ice water to alleviate the searing burning feeling which now had tears running down one side of my face. But I couldn’t see out of my left eye and thus had no depth perception as I reached for my ice water.</p>
        <p>I knocked the glass of ice water off balance and, in my desperate attempt to keep it from falling, my elbow hit one of the tall pillar candles. I realized in the back of my mind that Lucas had stopped talking.</p>
        <p>The ice water glass remained upright, ironically, as the lit tip of the candle fell neatly into the pile of linen napkins by my plate.</p>
        <p>Foom!</p>
        <p>I couldn’t see out of my left eye, but I looked across the table through the flames with my right eye and met Lucas’ gaze. His expression was indescribable, something between horror and disbelief.</p>
        <p>We both stared at the small fire that was now growing bigger in the middle of our table. I tried to shout “Fire!” but all that came out was a loud squeak.</p>
        <p>Lucas looked around wildly for a waiter. “Help!”</p>
        <p>In the minutes of chaos that followed, I learned several things: how flammable everything is, how quickly an entire restaurant full of people can be evacuated, and why you aren’t supposed to park in front of a fire hydrant.</p>
